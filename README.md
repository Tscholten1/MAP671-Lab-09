Devils Tower National Monument
Lessons learned:
•	Created elevation contours with GDAL
•	Used Qgis tools to clip raster by extent and extract elevation contour lines
•	Used Qgis raster and field calculators
•	Worked with MapBox to import raster and vector layers
•	Styled and published map of Devils Tower, WYO showing the spatial extent and contour lines based on the USGS 1/3 arc-second DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
•	Data is shown on Mapbox web map with geolocation services enabled
•	Used GDAL and QGIS 3.6 to convert raster elevation units and create contours.
